                    <p>The Common Core Standards for Mathematics establish new and more rigorous learning objectives, however the standards do not specify how they should be organized. With the generous support of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Illustrative Mathematics and Mathalicious have organized the Common Core standards into instructional units so that educators at the state, district, or school level donâ€™t have to.</p>

                    <p>While these Unit Blueprints organize the standards, they are not intended to serve as a comprehensive curriculum. Instead, they offer expert guidance for how to organize the standards, and act as a framework that can help educators successfully transition to the Common Core.</p>
